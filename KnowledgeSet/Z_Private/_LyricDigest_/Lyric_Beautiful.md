# ---Lyric_Fragment---  
I wanna be blown away  
I wanna be swept off my feet  
I wanna meet the one who makes it hard for me to breathe  
I wanna be lost in love  
I wanna be your dream come true  
I wanna be scared of how strong I feel for you  

#  ---Lyric_Fragment--- 
My heart is waiting for your love  
My hand is waiting for your touch  
My lips just wanna be kissed by you
